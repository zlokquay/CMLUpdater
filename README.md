# CMLUpdater
Use this to update your CML without visiting the website. Consider using a windows task or a mac/linux cronjob to automate.

### Requirements:
* Python requests library - `pip install requests`

### To run as a one-off script: 
* #### Command Line
* `$ cd path/to/directory`
* `$ python3 cmlupdate.py`

* You can also use IDLE/Visual Studio Code/Some other interpreter to run the program.

### To run automatically:
* Use your OS task scheduler. For windows, you must create a `.bat` file as you cannot just run python with the scheduler.
